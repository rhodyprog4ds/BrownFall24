# Generic Extension Ideas

### Extension

If there were parts of your previous assignments that you thought were interesting and you want to work with those data more, you can. You need to do *more complex* analyses of them, but you can build off of what you already have done, especially for assignments 2, 3, and 5. 



## Extend Assignment 7, 8, or 9   

Assignments 7-9 help you think through what machine learning tasks are.
Extend those ideas by adding additional experiments based on your own questions
or the questions in your feedback.

If you are short on time these achievements are easiest to combine with the optimize, compare, representation and workflow in the next portfolio

## Learn a new model

Repeat what you did in 7, 8, or 9, with a different model.

## Interview Style Critique

Book a 1:1 appointment with Dr. Brown (link on course organizaiton page and prismia) and critique/improve your own code + excerpts she provides.  

These will be **in person** in Tyler 134. 

This will allow you to demonstrate a deeper understanding than work you have previously submitted.
