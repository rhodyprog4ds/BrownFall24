# Evaluating ML Algorithms

This week we are going to start learning about machine learning.

We are going to do this by looking at how to tell if machine learning has worked.

This is because:
- you have to check if one worked after you build one
- if you do not check carefully, it might only sometimes work
- gives you a chance to learn *only* evaluation instead of evaluation + an ML task



## What is a Machine Learning Algorithm? 


First, what is an Algorithm?


> An algorithm is a set of ordered steps to complete a task.




Note that when people outside of CS talk about algorithms that impact people's lives these are often *not written directly by people* anymore.  They are often the result of machine learning.



In machine learning, people write an algorithm for how to write an algorithm based on data.  This often comes in the form of a statitistical model of some sort.



![Ml overview: training data goes into the learning algorithm, which outputs the prediction algorithm. the prediciton algorithm takes a sampleand outputs a prediction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/refs/heads/main/img/MLdataflow.png)




When we *do* machine learning, this can also be called:
- data mining
- pattern recognition
- modeling

because we are looking for patterns in the data and typically then planning to
use those patterns to make predictions or automate a task.  

Each of these terms does have slightly different meanings and usage, but
sometimes they're used close to exchangeably.





## How can we tell if ML is working?  

We measure the performance of the prediction algorithm, to determine if the learning algorithm worked. 




## Replicating the COMPAS Audit
We are going to replicate the audit from ProPublica [Machine Bias](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)





### Why COMPAS?


Propublica started the COMPAS Debate with the article [Machine Bias](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencin).  With their article, they also released details of their methodology and their [data and code](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis).  This presents a real data set that can be used for research on how data is used in a criminal justice setting without researchers having to perform their own requests for information, so it has been used and reused a lot of times.





### Propublica COMPAS Data


The dataset consists of COMPAS scores assigned to defendants over two years 2013-2014 in Broward County, Florida, it was released by Propublica in a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis/). These scores are determined by a proprietary algorithm designed to evaluate a persons recidivism risk - the likelihood that they will reoffend. Risk scoring algorithms are widely used by judges to inform their sentencing and bail decisions in the criminal justice system in the United States.

The journalists collected, for each person arreste din 2013 and 2014:
- basic demographics
- details about what they were charged with and priors
- the COMPAS score assigned to them
- if they had actually been re-arrested within 2 years of their arrest

This means that we have what the COMPAS algorithm predicted (in the form of a score from 1-10) and what actually happened (re-arrested or not). We can then measure how well the algorithm worked, in practice, in the real world.  




Now we will start our notebook

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import metrics
import seaborn as sns
```
We're going to work with a cleaned copy of the data released by Propublica that also has a minimal subset of features.

* `age`: defendant's age
* `c_charge_degree`: degree charged (Misdemeanor of Felony)
* `race`: defendant's race
* `age_cat`: defendant's age quantized in "less than 25", "25-45", or "over 45"
* `score_text`: COMPAS score: 'low'(1 to 5), 'medium' (5 to 7), and 'high' (8 to 10).
* `sex`: defendant's gender
* `priors_count`: number of prior charges
* `days_b_screening_arrest`: number of days between charge date and arrest where defendant was screened for compas score
* `decile_score`: COMPAS score from 1 to 10 (low risk to high risk)
* `is_recid`: if the defendant recidivized
* `two_year_recid`: if the defendant within two years
* `c_jail_in`: date defendant was imprisoned
* `c_jail_out`: date defendant was released from jail
* `length_of_stay`: length of jail stay


```{code-cell} ipython3
compas_clean_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml4sts/outreach-compas/main/data/compas_c.csv'
compas_df = pd.read_csv(compas_clean_url)
compas_df.head()
```

## One-hot Encoding

We will audit first to see how good the algorithm is by treating the predictions as either high or not high.  One way we can get to that point is to transform the `score_text` column from one column with three values, to 3 binary columns.


First lets understand the `score_text`

```{code-cell} ipython3
compas_df.groupby('score_text')['decile_score'].agg(['min','max'])
```
`agg` is short for aggregate. It allows us to apply one or more functions to a dataframe (or groupby) along a single axis (rows or columns). It is similar to apply but allows us to pass a list of functions or function names and similar to `describe` but allows us to make custom summary tables. 

You can learn more about [agg from its docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.agg.html) or with visuals on [pandas tutor](https://pandastutor.com/vis.html#code=import%20pandas%20as%20pd%0Aimport%20io%0A%0Acsv%20%3D%20'''%0Abreed,size,weight,height%0ALabrador%20Retriever,medium,67.5,23.0%0AGerman%20Shepherd,large,,24.0%0ABeagle,small,,14.0%0AGolden%20Retriever,medium,60.0,22.75%0AYorkshire%20Terrier,small,5.5,%0ABulldog,medium,45.0,%0ABoxer,medium,,23.25%0APoodle,medium,,16.0%0ADachshund,small,24.0,%0ARottweiler,large,,24.5%0A'''%0Adogs%20%3D%20pd.read_csv%28io.StringIO%28csv%29%29%0A%0A%28dogs%0A%20%20.sort_values%28'size'%29%0A%20%20.groupby%28'size'%29%5B'height'%5D%0A%20%20.agg%28%5B'sum',%20'mean',%20'std'%5D%29%0A%29&d=2024-10-09&lang=py&v=v1)

To see what one hot encoding looks like, we will apply it first to just the one column. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.get_dummies(compas_df['score_text'])
```


Since we atually want all of the columns with that one expanded, we will apply it a different way to save it to a variable. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
compas_df_onehot = pd.get_dummies(compas_df,columns=['score_text'])
```
We will also audit with respect to a second threshold. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
compas_onehot['MedHigh'] = compas_onehot['High'] + compas_onehot['Medium']
```



## Sklearn Performance metrics 



The first thing we usually check is the accuracy: the percentage of all samples that are correct.  



```{code-cell} ipython3
metrics.accuracy_score(compas_onehot['two_year_recid'],
                       compas_onehot['MedHigh'])
```

```{important}
all `sklearn.metrics` functions have the same first two parameters: 
- `y_true` the *real world* outcome our model tries to predict
- `y_pred` the *model's predictions
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
metrics.accuracy_score(compas_onehot['two_year_recid'],
                       compas_onehot['High'])
```

the accuracy is not great either way

````{margin}
```{note}
the wikipedia page for confusion matrix is a really good reference
```
````
However this does not tell us anything about what *types* of mistakes the algorithm made.  The type of mistake often matters in terms of how we trust or deploy an algorithm.  We use a [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) to describe the performance in more detail.



A confusion matrix counts the number of samples of each *true* category that wre predicted to be in each category. In this case we have a binary prediction problem: people either are re-arrested (truth) or not and were given a high score or not(prediction).  In binary problems we adopt a common language of labeling one outcome/predicted value positive and the other negative.  We do this not based on the social value of the outcome, but on the numerical encoding.  

In this data, being re-arrested is indicated by a 1 in the `two_year_recid` column, so this is the *positive class* and not being re-arrested is 0, so the *negative class*.  Similarly a high score is 1, so that's the *positive prediction* and not high is 0, so that is the a *negative prediction*.  



[docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html)
```{code-cell} ipython3
metrics.confusion_matrix(compas_onehot['two_year_recid'],
                       compas_onehot['MedHigh'])
```

```{code-block}
:linenos-start:35
:filename: metrics.confusion_matrix.__doc__
Returns
    -
    C : ndarray of shape (n_classes, n_classes)
        Confusion matrix whose i-th row and j-th
        column entry indicates the number of
        samples with true label being i-th class
        and predicted label being j-th class.
```
Using the help above, we can label the axes and put this in a dataFrame to make it easier to read. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
cf = metrics.confusion_matrix(compas_onehot['two_year_recid'],
                       compas_onehot['MedHigh'])
pd.DataFrame(data =cf,columns = ['low score','medium or high score'],
             index = ['not rearrested','rearrested'])
```

```{note}
these terms can be used in any sort of detection problem, whether machine learning is used or not
```

`sklearn.metrics` provides a `[confusion matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html)` function that we can use.


Since this is binary problem we have 4 possible outcomes:
- true negatives($C_{0,0}$): did not get a high score and were not re-arrested
- false negatives($C_{1,0}$):: did not get a high score and were re-arrested
- false positives($C_{0,1}$):: got a high score and were not re-arrested
- true positives($C_{1,1}$):: got a high score and were re-arrested


With these we can revisit accuracy:

$$ A = \frac{C_{0,0} + C_{1,1}}{C_{0,0}+ C_{1,0} + C_{0,1} + C_{1,1}} $$


and we can define new scores. 

## Precision and Recall

Two common ones in CS are recall and precision.

Recall is:

$$ R = \frac{C_{1,1}}{C_{1,0} + C_{1,1}} $$
```{code-cell} ipython3
metrics.recall_score(compas_onehot['two_year_recid'],
                       compas_onehot['MedHigh'])
```

That is, among the truly positive class how many were correctly predicted?  In COMPAS, it's the percentage of the re-arrested people who got a high score.


Precision is
$$ P = \frac{C_{1,1}}{C_{0,1} + C_{1,1}} $$

```{code-cell} ipython3
metrics.precision_score(compas_onehot['two_year_recid'],
                       compas_onehot['MedHigh'])
```


## Per Group Scores 

To groupby and then do the score, we can use a lambda, with apply

```{code-cell} ipython3
acc_fx  = lambda d: metrics.accuracy_score(d['two_year_recid'],d['MedHigh'])
compas_onehot.groupby('race').apply(acc_fx)
```

That lambda + apply is equivalent to:
```{code-cell} ipython3
race_acc = []
for race, rdf in compas_race:
    acc = skmetrics.accuracy_score(rdf['two_year_recid'],
             rdf['score_text_MedHigh'])
    race_acc.append([race,acc])

pd.DataFrame(race_acc, columns =['race','accuracy'])
```

then we can do the same thing for recall and precision. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
recall_fx  = lambda d: metrics.recall_score(d['two_year_recid'],d['MedHigh'])
compas_onehot.groupby('race').apply(recall_fx)
```

The recall tells us that the model has very different impact on people.  On the other hand the precision tells us the scores mean about the same thing for Black and White people. 



Researchers established that these are mutually exclusive, provably.  We cannot have both, so it is very important to think about what the performance metrics mean and how your algorithm will be used in order to choose how to prepare a model.  We will train models starting next week, but knowing these goals in advance is essential.

Importantly, this is not a statistical, computational choice that data can answer for us. This is about *human* values (and to some extent the law; certain domains have legal protections that require a specific condition).

The Fair Machine Learning book's classificaiton Chapter has a [section on relationships between criteria](https://fairmlbook.org/classification.html#relationships-between-criteria) with the proofs.


Looking at this gives a larger seeming difference to make it more clear, the error rate is almost twice as high. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
1-compas_onehot.groupby('race').apply(recall_fx)
```

Note this is almost double the error rate


```{code-cell} ipython3
precision_fx  = lambda d: metrics.precision_score(d['two_year_recid'],d['MedHigh'])
compas_onehot.groupby('race').apply(precision_fx)
```


```{important}

We used ProPublica's COMPAS dataset to replicate (parts of, with different tools) their analysis. That is, they collected the dataset in order to audit the COMPAS algorithm and we used it for the same purpose (and to learn model evaluation).  This dataset is not designed for *training* models, even though it has been used as such many times.  This is [not the best way](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=qeM58whnpXM) to use this dataset and for future assignments I do not recommend using this dataset.

## Questions

### Does ChatGPT have a dataset similar to Compas? How accurate are the AI's that students are using instead of learning?

We do not know *exactly* what the training data for ChatGPT i, it uses OpenAI's modelGPT3.5 and beyond.  I also want to clarify that the dataset we used today was some journalists' data to *audit* COMPAS.  It was trained on *different* data.  

However for GPT3, OpenAI published a [paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Abstract.html) in section 2.2 they state that their training data includes (links are mine; they had citations): 
> -  filtered version of [CommonCrawl1](https://commoncrawl.org/) 
> - an expanded version of the [WebText dataset](https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/)
> - two sets of books
> - English Language Wikipedia

### There was a lot in this lecture today. What generally should be the take away from today's class?

The performance metrics and what ML *is* roughly, though we will come back to that. 

### What's the difference between precision score and recall score?

Mathematically, the denominator. 

Conceptually, the precision is a perfect score (1) if there are no false *positives* but the precision score is not impacted by there being false negatives.  Precision is a measure of how many of the high scores were actually re-arrested, it only cares about when the algorithm predicts the positive class.  

In contrast, a perfect recall only requires no false *negatives* and is not impacted by false positives at all.  Recall only cares about the actually positive class, here the people who *acutally* got re-arrested and how well the model performed on those people. 
Recall is how many of the the thing we want were found in a radar context. 


### how to combat biased data

This is still a really open area of research and it is context dependent.  The COMPAS audit showed that there are different ways that we can write euqations to try to represent fairness and researchers proved that these cannot all be true at the same time.  

In this case, I would actually not say that the "data is biased" because in statistics, biased data refers to a type of not correct measurement. This data reflects the way the actual **world** is biased. 

### I guess when should and shouldn't you use one-hot?

We use one hot encoding when we want to numerically represent categorical data and if we want to do something that is like binary for one of the values for a variable with more than 2 values. 

### What are some good intro resourses you suggest for looking more into some of the math that make up these machine learning models that we will use in this class?

For the purposes of this course, the [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) documentation is a good starting point.  It has the specific equations that are implemented in the package, which is relevant for some models that have multiple ways they can be implemented.
