# Breaking Down a problem


We discussed in class and students in class got individual feedback on their plan for A11. 


## strategies

_you'll generally have to mix strategies_

these processes, not the answer, are the most important thing to get good at, building next level AI systems is about this type of abstract thinking



### Work backwards

- Try to think about what the solution should look like
- then what do you do to get that 
- then what are the input requirements for that step 
- and repeat


### break it down

- try to expand each part of the instructions into more detail
- keep going until you know what to do

### leave blanks
- if you do not know something, leave a "blank" or a variable and work on other parts
- when you have more of a plan, sometimes the missing piece is easier to figure out
