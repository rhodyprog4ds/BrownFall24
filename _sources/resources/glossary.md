# Glossary



```{glossary}

[aggregate](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.aggregate.html#pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.aggregate)
  to combine data in some way, a function that can produce a customized summary table

[anonymous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function#:~:text=Anonymous%20functions%20are%20often%20arguments,than%20using%20a%20named%20function)
  a function that's defined on the fly, typically to lighten syntax or return a function within a function. In python, they're defined with the {term}`lambda` keyword.

[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
  a python library used to assist in web scraping, it pulls data from html and xml files that can be parsed in a variety of different ways using different methods.


conditional 
  a logical control to do something, conditioned on something else, for example the `if`, `elif` `else` 


corpus
  (NLP) a set of documents for analysis 

[DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)
  a data structure provided by pandas for tabular data in python.

[dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-dictionary)
  (data type) a mapping array that matches keys to values. (in NLP) all of the possible tokens a model knows

discriminative 
  a model that describes the decision rule for labeling a sample as one class or another

document
  unit of text for analysis (one sample). Could be one sentence, one paragraph, or an article, depending on the goal

generative
  a model that describes the data and therefore can also be used to generate new data that looks like the training data. 

gh 
  GitHub's command line tools

git
  a version control tool; it's a fully open source and always free tool, that can be hosted by anyone or used without a host, locally only.

GitHub
  a hosting service for git repositories

index
  (verb) to index into a data structure means to pick out specified items, for example index into a list or a index into a data frame. Indexing usually invovlees square brackets `[]`
  (noun) the index of a dataframe is like a column, but it can be used to refer to the rows. It's the list of names for the rows.

interpreter
  the translator from human readable python code to something the computer can run.  An interpreted language means you can work with python interactively

iterate
  To do the same thing to each item in an {term}`iterable` data structure, typically, an iterable type. Iterating is usually described as iterate over some data structure and typically uses the `for` keyword

[iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable)
  any object in python that can return its members one at a time. The most common example is a list, but there are others.

kernel
  in the jupyter environment, [the kernel](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html#kernel) is a language specific computational engine

[lambda](https://docs.python.org/3.9/reference/expressions.html#lambda)
  they keyword used to define an anonymous function; lambda functions are defined with a compact syntax `<name> = lambda <parameters>: <body>`

numpy array 
  a type provided by [numpy]() to represent matrices, used by `pd.DataFrame.values` [doc](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.values.html) and accessed by `pd.DataFrame.to_numpy` [doc](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_numpy.html#pandas.DataFrame.to_numpy)

[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/pep-0008/)
  [Python Enhancement Proposal](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) 8, the Style Guide for Python Code.

repository
  a project folder with tracking information in it in the form of a .git file

[Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html)
  a data structure provided by pandas for single columnar data with an index.  Subsetting a Dataframe or applying a function to one will often produce a Series

shape
  of a dataframe, or matrix is the number of rows and columns. 

[Split Apply Combine](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine)
  a paradigm for splitting data into groups using a column, applying some function(aggregation, transformation, or filtration) to each piece and combinging in the individual pieces back together to a single table

stop words
  Words that do not convey important meaning, we donâ€™t need them (like a, the, an,). Note that this is context dependent. These words are removed when transforming text to numerical representation

suffix
  additional part of the name that gets added to end of a name in a merge operation

test accuracy
  percentage of predictions that the model predict correctly, based on held-out (previously unseen) test data

[Tidy Data Format](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10)
  Tidy data is a database format that ensures data is easy to manipulate, model and visualize.
  The specific rules of Tidy Data are as follows: Each variable is a column,
  each row is an observation, and each observable unit is a table.

token
  a sequence of characters in some particular document that are grouped together as a useful semantic unit for processing (typically a word, but more gneeral)

TraceBack
  an error message in python that traces back from the line of code that had caused the exception back through all of the functions that called other functions to reach that line. This is sometimes call tracing back through the stack

training accuracy
  percentage of predictions that the model predict correctly, based on the training data

transpose
  swap the rows and columns of a matrix or dataframe

Web Scraping
  the process of extracting data from a website. In the context of this class, this is usually done using
  the python library beautiful soup and a html parser to retrieve specific data.
