# Check 2 Ideas

For Check 2, all of the prompts from check 1 apply, plus the following additional
prompts, since there are new skills.  

If you have other ideas, you can also ask and those are likely posible.  

## Level 1 Achievement Catchup

To make up level 1 achievements, include a detailed introduction file to your
portfolio and one of the following (per skill):

- minor extensions to what we did in class
- answers to problems from the notes
- additional glossary terms
- psuedocode for one of the other prompts


## Extend Assignment 7, 8, or 9   

Assignments 7-9 help you think through what machine learning tasks are.
Extend those ideas by adding additional experiments based on your own questions
or the questions in your feedback.

If you are short on time these achievements are easiest to combine with the optimize, compare, representation and workflow in the next portfolio

## Build a data set for Prediction

Build a dataset that works for prediction (classification, regression, or clustering)
from other sources.

## Learn a new model

Repeat what you did in 7, 8, or 9, with a different model.

## Create datasets that fail

Create datasets that violate assumptions of a model we have learned.  The
[sklearn data generators](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/sample_generators.html#generated-datasets) are a good place to start.  



## Process level 3


Process level 3 is a little different than most of the others.  You may be able
to work it into an analysis notebook, but likely, you'll need to do one of the
following.

### Data Science Pipeline Comparisons

Find two different sources that describe the data science pipeline or lifecycle. Write a blog style post that discusses their differences and hypothesizes about why they may be different? Are they for different audiences? Is one domain specific? How do they emphasize different modeling tasks?
Include a Recommendation for when you think each one is better

### Write a short story

Write a short story that explains the concepts of data science to demonstrate your
understanding of process.

### Media Review

Watch/listen/read to an episode of a high quality[^hq] podcast or other type of media
and write a blog style summary and review. Highlight what you learned and how it
relates to topics covered in class.
