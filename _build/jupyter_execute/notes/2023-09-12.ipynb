    "## Questions After Class\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### I think this something I need to figure but how do the localhost or just utilizing a url in VS Code? I was late to the class, I never got how to do the jupyter lab thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this class, you need to use jupyter notebooks without extraneous metadata.  If you use jupyter inside of vs code, it adds extraneous metadata that makes it hard to grade and VS code, in my experience, does not provide the most helpful autocomplete for Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see office hours to get help with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Is the Python we use in Jupyter lab notebooks any different from traditional Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "the Python is mostly all the same.  There are different python interpreters that have some slightly different behaviors, but mostly only in the display.  As a matter of technicality, jupyter uses the [ipython](https://ipython.org/documentation.html) python as the kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Does index just list all the rows?\n",
    "\n",
    "the index is the *name* of the rows the same way that the column headers are the *name* of the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How you copied the file url from github.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the [raw button](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#viewing-or-copying-the-raw-file-content) and then copy the URL from your browswer's url bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How did we change the index?\n",
    "\n",
    "we changed the index from the inferred (figured out by pandas) `RangeIndex` to a column of the data by adding the `index_col=0` parameter  to our `read_csv` call.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### I would like to learn more about the panda commands\n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue learning more pandas features for the next few weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### are we gonna have to use what we learned today in a bigger program in the future \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, these features we used today are the basis of all of the data analysis we will do all semester.  However, we will not be writing \"programs\" the way you may have for other classes, we will be doing data analyses, which are more narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can I use Jupyter to clean data?\n",
    "\n",
    "jupyter is a way to work with python code.  We will learn what clean data looks like and more ways to manipulate dataframes to make it clean in two weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is taking data from columns much more common than taking it from rows? \n",
    "\n",
    "We set our data up so that each column is a varible.  We often want to treat different variables differently, but do the same thing to all of the rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "### I was wondering more about the Index variable type and was also curious as to what that could be used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "the `Index` type from `pandas` is a component of a `DataFrame`, we will use them implicitly whenever we work with a part of a dataframe and explicitly when we clean data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### I know by convention we use the typical alias for importing libraries, but is it okay to use our own alias for our own private programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "using nonstandard aliases is a bad habit to develop and I cannot endorse it. Technically the code will run, but in class it will be a style violation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### does the panda's data start indexing at 1 because 0 is where the table headers are located?\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing using `loc` started at 1 because the dataset had 1 there, in the second example it started at 5.  \n",
    "\n",
    "using `iloc` starts at 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "### In the dataset we loaded, I noticed that there were some zeros, which are nulls, I'm guessing we have to clean those out, and I was wondering how?\n",
    "\n",
    "zeros are a value, nulls are encoded in different ways.  We will learn how to deal will missing values in two weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How often do data sets need to be cleaned/manipulated before proper analysis can be done?\n",
    "\n",
    "Real data, will almost alwasy need to be fixed a little bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "### how does being able to view specific rows/columns help us make conclusions about data?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, maybe one column is the thing you are interested in, you may want to know on stats on the one column. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Are assignments always a certain level or can one assignment be done to be a level 1 or a level 2 assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, Assignments are always targeted at level 2. In class prismia questions will assess at level 1.  An incomplete attempt at an assignment might be evaluated only at level 1, so that can be a way to make up for missed class and then you earn the level 2 in the next assignment that assess that skill. \n",
    "\n",
    "### will I be able to use data from an existing lab that I work in for certain assignment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, as long as the data is allowed to be shared.  Please confirm with your PI. \n",
    "\n",
    "### When we submit to GitHub, do we need to do anything other than upload the file?\n",
    "\n",
    "For your portfolio, no.  For other assignments, there will be a step to do, and there will be instructions in the assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Are we going to have to create our own datasets for any future assignments rather than downloading datasets form the Internet?\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment 2 you will build a dataset about datasets, but other than that you will mostly use datasets that you find online or that you have for another purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to better navigate github and not second guess my posts there\n",
